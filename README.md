## About Mocha Pro

Developed by **Boris FX**, Mocha Pro revolutionized visual effects tracking with its **planar tracking engine** — capable of following surfaces and patterns instead of just points.  

Unlike traditional trackers, Mocha analyzes texture and shape, allowing **accurate tracking even when objects leave the frame or are partially occluded**.  
It’s the tool behind countless blockbuster films and TV shows, used for **stabilization, cleanup, matte generation, and screen replacement**.  

With its **PowerMesh feature**, Mocha Pro adds **sub-planar tracking** — ideal for complex deformations like clothing, faces, and organic motion.  
Artists can export data to all major applications including **Nuke, After Effects, Flame, Fusion, Resolve**, and others.
